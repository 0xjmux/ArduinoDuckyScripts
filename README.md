# ArduinoDuckyScripts
A collection of my Ducky Scripts for an Arduino Pro Micro, that I am using as a stand in for an actual USB Rubber Ducky because of price.

### An Introduction
So, as a student, I can't afford to pay for an actual USB Rubber Ducky, so I am using the open source version. The open source version is a knockoff Arduino Pro Micro that I bought from China for a total price of around $3, and put together with parts I had lying around. 

The current version has a pushbutton soldered on to pins 3 and ground on the left side of the board, and a mini usb otg adapter for a plug. 

I will be uploading the scripts I create for this little guy here, so that others can hopefully use them. Everything is coded in the Arduino IDE, using the Keyboard and Mouse libraries. The varying scripts are each in their own folder, so the repository can be cloned and the scripts can be immediately opened in the Arduino IDE.
